 * The standard midpoint-split kd-tree.  This is not the original formulation by
 * Bentley but instead the later formulation by Deng and Moore, which only holds
 * points in the leaves of the tree.  When recursively splitting nodes, the
 * KDTree class select the dimension with maximum variance to split on, and
 * picks the midpoint of the range in that dimension as the value on which to
 * split nodes.

 * each node is a ball, not a hyper-rectangle.  This can make the ball tree
 * advantageous in some higher-dimensional situations and for some datasets.

 * construction algorithm', except the splitting value is the midpoint, not the
 * median.  This can result in trees that better reflect the data, although they
